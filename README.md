## Using CN devtools

This project consists of two parts: The instrumentation library and the visualization client. You will need both in order to debug Rust programs.

### Adding the instrumentation library

The instrumentation library can be used like any regular Rust `log` or `tracing` frontend. Add it to your crate's dependencies:

```toml
subscriber = { git = "https://github.com/crabnebula-dev/devtools" }
```

And initialize it in your main function. It is important that you initialize it **as early as possible**

```rust
fn main() {
  let context = tauri::generate_context!();

  subscriber::init(&context);

  tauri::Builder::default()
      .run(context)
      .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

### Installing the client

The client gathers the data collected by the instrumentation library and presents it in a human readable and interactive way. There are currently no pre-compiled builds so you will have to build it from source (make sure you have all the [prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) to build tauri apps!)

```shell
# clone the git repo
git clone https://github.com/crabnebula-dev/devtools

# build the app
cargo tauri build
```

Now you can run the app! Active instrumented apps on your local network will appear in the "Live Sessions" section
